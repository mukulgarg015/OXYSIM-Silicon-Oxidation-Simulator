# OXYSIM-Silicon-Oxidation-Simulator
The tool models dry as well as wet oxidation using both Deal-Grove and Massoud models. The oxidation parameters can be given as input, and the output is the final oxide thickness. An option to plot the final oxide thickness as a function of time is also available. The tool also supports multistage oxidation. 
For more information checkout the tool's documentation.
